            <h2>What is C#?</h2>
            <p>C# is a versatile, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft. It is widely used for building a variety of applications, including:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Desktop applications</strong>: Create robust applications for Windows.</li>
                <li><strong>Web applications and services</strong>: Develop dynamic websites and APIs.</li>
                <li><strong>Mobile apps</strong>: Build cross-platform mobile applications using frameworks like Xamarin.</li>
                <li><strong>Games</strong>: Utilize game development engines like Unity.</li>
                <li><strong>Enterprise software</strong>: Implement large-scale business solutions.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>C# is known for its simplicity, robustness, and extensive libraries, making it a popular choice for developers across various industries.</p>

            <h2>Concepts</h2>
            <p>Business Process Management (BPM) is a discipline that focuses on improving business processes by analyzing, modeling, executing, and optimizing them. In this course, we'll be introducing some key BPM concepts and how they relate to software development:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Cases:</strong> A case represents a specific instance of a business process. For example, in a customer service application, each customer inquiry would be considered a case.</li>
                <li><strong>Work Items:</strong> Work items are tasks that need to be completed within a case. They represent the individual steps in a business process.</li>
            </ol>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>BPM with C#</h2>
            <p>Throughout this course, we'll be exploring how to incorporate BPM principles into C# programming. By understanding these concepts, you'll be able to design and develop applications that better reflect real-world business processes, streamlining your operations and improving efficiency.</p>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Hands-on Example</h2>
            <p>Let’s start with a practical example to illustrate how we can use C# to represent a basic BPM scenario. Imagine we have a customer service application where customers can submit inquiries. Each inquiry is a case, and it consists of several work items (e.g., gathering customer information, researching the issue, providing a solution).</p>
            <pre><code id="code-example" class="language-cs">public class Inquiry
{
    public int InquiryId { get; set; }
    public string CustomerName { get; set; }
    public string InquiryDescription { get; set; }
    public Case Case { get; set; }
}

public class Case
{
    public int CaseId { get; set; }
    public Inquiry Inquiry { get; set; }
    public List&lt;WorkItem&gt; WorkItems { get; set; } = new List&lt;WorkItem&gt;();

    public void AddWorkItem(WorkItem workItem)
    {
       WorkItems.Add(workItem);
    }
}

public class WorkItem
{
    public int WorkItemId { get; set; }
    public string Description { get; set; }
    public Case Case { get; set; }
}</code></pre>
        </section>

        <section>
            <h2>Conclusion:</h2>
            <p>In this first lesson, we've introduced C# as a powerful programming language and discussed how we'll be incorporating BPM concepts throughout the course. We also explored a practical example of how to represent inquiries, cases, and work items in C# using classes and their relationships.</p>
            <p>In the next lesson, we’ll dive deeper into core programming concepts in C#, such as variables, data types, and control structures. We’ll also introduce some basic coding exercises to reinforce your learning. Stay tuned!</p>
